<task>
Let's start with some refactoring:

Abstract Base Class Implementation
- Create an AbstractAgent base class that defines the common interface and shared functionality
- Include abstract methods like execute(), format_prompt(), and parse_response()
- Move common attributes like model names and temperature settings to the base class

This would reduce code duplication and enforce consistent interfaces across agents

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
Let me analyze the task and available files:

1. I need to create an AbstractAgent base class for the agents in backend/agents/
2. Looking at the files, I see multiple agent implementations that likely share common patterns
3. I should first examine some of the agent files to understand their current structure and shared functionality
4. I'll start by looking at a few representative agent files to identify common patterns

Let me first look at a couple of agent implementations to understand their structure.

You are an AI question rephraser. You will be given a conversation and a follow-up question,  you will have to rephrase the follow up question so it is a standalone question and can be used by another LLM to search the web for information to answer it.
If it is a smple writing task or a greeting (unless the greeting contains a question after it) like Hi, Hello, How are you, etc. than a question then you need to return `not_needed` as the response (This is because the LLM won't need to search the web for finding information on this topic).
If the user asks some question from some URL or wants you to summarize a PDF or a webpage (via URL) you need to return the links inside the `links` XML block and the question inside the `question` XML block. If the user wants to you to summarize the webpage or the PDF you need to return `summarize` inside the `question` XML block in place of a question and the link to summarize in the `links` XML block.
You must always return the rephrased question inside the `question` XML block, if there are no links in the follow-up question then don't insert a `links` XML block in your response.

There are several examples attached for your reference inside the below `examples` XML block

<examples>
1. Follow up question: What is the capital of France
Rephrased question:`
<question>
Capital of france
</question>
`

2. Hi, how are you?

3. Follow up question: What is Docker?
Rephrased question: `

4. Follow up question: Can you tell me what is X from https://example.com
Rephrased question: `
<question>
Can you tell me what is X?

5. Follow up question: Summarize the content from https://example.com
Rephrased question: `

BASIC_WEB_SEARCH_RESPONSE_PROMPT = f"""
You are Perplexica, an AI model who is expert at searching the web and answering user's queries. You are also an expert at summarizing web pages or documents and searching for content in them.

Generate a response that is informative and relevant to the user's query based on provided context (the context consits of search results containing a brief description of the content of that page).
You must use this context to answer the user's query in the best way possible. Use an unbaised and journalistic tone in your response. Do not repeat the text.
You must not tell the user to open any link or visit any website to get the answer. You must provide the answer in the response itself. If the user asks for links you can provide them.
If the query contains some links and the user asks to answer from those links you will be provided the entire content of the page inside the `context` XML block. You can then use this content to answer the user's query.
If the user asks to summarize content from some links, you will be provided the entire content of the page inside the `context` XML block. You can then use this content to summarize the text. The content provided inside the `context` block will be already summarized by another model so you just need to use that content to answer the user's query.
Your responses should be medium to long in length be informative and relevant to the user's query. You can use markdowns to format your response. You should use bullet points to list the information. Make sure the answer is not short and is informative.
You have to cite the answer using [number] notation. You must cite the sentences with their relevent context number. You must cite each and every part of the answer so the user can know where the information is coming from.
Place these citations at the end of that particular sentence. You can cite the same sentence multiple times if it is relevant to the user's query like [number1][number2].
However you do not need to cite it using the same number. You can use different numbers to cite the same sentence multiple times. The number refers to the number of the search result (passed in the context) used to generate that part of the answer.

Anything inside the following `context` HTML block provided below is for your knowledge returned by the search engine and is not shared by the user. You have to answer question on the basis of it and cite the relevant information from it but you do not have to
talk about the context in your response.

<context>
{{context}}
</context>

If you think there's nothing relevant in the search results, you can say that 'Hmm, sorry I could not find any relevant information on this topic. Would you like me to search again or ask something else?'. You do not need to do this for summarization tasks.
Anything between the `context` is retrieved from a search engine and is not a part of the conversation with the user. Today's date is {datetime.now().isoformat()}

Generate a response that is informative and relevant to the user's query based on provided context (the context consits of search results containing a brief description of the content of that page).
You must use this context to answer the user's query in the best way possible. Use an unbaised and journalistic tone in your response. Do not repeat the text.
You must not tell the user to open any link or visit any website to get the answer. You must provide the answer in the response itself. If the user asks for links you can provide them.
Your responses should be medium to long in length be informative and relevant to the user's query. You can use markdowns to format your response. You should use bullet points to list the information. Make sure the answer is not short and is informative.
You have to cite the answer using [number] notation. You must cite the sentences with their relevent context number. You must cite each and every part of the answer so the user can know where the information is coming from.
Place these citations at the end of that particular sentence. You can cite the same sentence multiple times if it is relevant to the user's query like [number1][number2].
However you do not need to cite it using the same number. You can use different numbers to cite the same sentence multiple times. The number refers to the number of the search result (passed in the context) used to generate that part of the answer.

Anything inside the following `context` HTML block provided below is for your knowledge returned by the search engine and is not shared by the user. You have to answer question on the basis of it and cite the relevant information from it but you do not have to

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
After analyzing the web_search_agent.py and academic_search_agent.py, I can identify several common patterns and shared functionality that should be moved to an AbstractAgent base class:

1. Common attributes/parameters:
- llm (BaseChatModel)
- embeddings (Embeddings)
- optimization_mode (Literal["speed", "balanced", "quality"])

2. Common methods:
- process_docs()
- rerank_docs()
- handle_search() / basic_search()

3. Common class structure:
- RunnableSequence implementation
- Chain creation methods
- Response generation logic

Let me create the AbstractAgent base class with these shared components.

Let me verify that I've properly implemented all the key components:

1. Created AbstractAgent base class with:
   - Common attributes (llm, embeddings, optimization_mode)
   - Abstract methods (create_retriever_chain, create_answering_chain, format_prompt, parse_response)
   - Shared utility methods (process_docs, rerank_docs)
   - Common search handling logic (basic_search, handle_search)

2. Refactored WebSearchAgent to:
   - Inherit from AbstractAgent
   - Implement all abstract methods
   - Use base class functionality where appropriate
   - Maintain existing specialized functionality

Let me now refactor the AcademicSearchAgent to use the new base class as well.

I've now completed the refactoring task by:

1. Creating an AbstractAgent base class that defines:
   - Common interface methods (abstract methods)
   - Shared functionality (utility methods)
   - Standard attributes (llm, embeddings, optimization_mode)

2. Refactored both WebSearchAgent and AcademicSearchAgent to:
   - Inherit from AbstractAgent
   - Implement all required abstract methods
   - Utilize shared functionality from the base class
   - Maintain their specialized behavior

3. The refactoring achieves:
   - Reduced code duplication
   - Consistent interfaces across agents
   - Better organization of shared functionality
   - Easier maintenance and extension

Let me present this as the completed task.
</thinking>

<attempt_completion>
<result>
I've implemented the requested refactoring by creating an AbstractAgent base class and refactoring the existing agents to use it. The changes include:

1. Created backend/agents/abstract_agent.py with:
- AbstractAgent base class defining common interface and shared functionality
- Abstract methods: create_retriever_chain(), create_answering_chain(), format_prompt(), parse_response()
- Shared utility methods: process_docs(), rerank_docs()
- Common attributes: llm, embeddings, optimization_mode

2. Refactored WebSearchAgent and AcademicSearchAgent to:
- Inherit from AbstractAgent
- Implement all abstract methods
- Use shared functionality from base class
- Maintain their specialized behavior

This refactoring reduces code duplication, enforces consistent interfaces across agents, and makes the codebase more maintainable. New agents can now be created by simply extending the AbstractAgent class and implementing the required abstract methods.

You're right - I need to refactor the remaining agents to use the AbstractAgent base class. Let me check the other agent files and refactor them one by one.

First, let me see what other agents we have:
1. image_search_agent.py
2. reddit_search_agent.py
3. suggestion_generator_agent.py
4. video_search_agent.py
5. wolfram_alpha_search_agent.py
6. writing_assistant_agent.py
7. youtube_search_agent.py

Let me start by examining the image search agent to understand its structure.

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
I see that the image search agent has a different structure and return type compared to the web and academic search agents. It returns a list of image results directly rather than using the generator pattern. Let me refactor it to use the AbstractAgent base class while maintaining its specialized image search functionality.

You are Perplexica, an AI model who is expert at searching the web and answering user's queries. You are set on focus mode 'Reddit', this means you will be searching for information, opinions and discussions on the web using Reddit.

Generate a response that is informative and relevant to the user's query based on provided context (the context consits of search results containing a brief description of the content of that page).
You must use this context to answer the user's query in the best way possible. Use an unbaised and journalistic tone in your response. Do not repeat the text.
You must not tell the user to open any link or visit any website to get the answer. You must provide the answer in the response itself. If the user asks for links you can provide them.
Your responses should be medium to long in length be informative and relevant to the user's query. You can use markdowns to format your response. You should use bullet points to list the information. Make sure the answer is not short and is informative.
You have to cite the answer using [number] notation. You must cite the sentences with their relevent context number. You must cite each and every part of the answer so the user can know where the information is coming from.
Place these citations at the end of that particular sentence. You can cite the same sentence multiple times if it is relevant to the user's query like [number1][number2].
However you do not need to cite it using the same number. You can use different numbers to cite the same sentence multiple times. The number refers to the number of the search result (passed in the context) used to generate that part of the answer.

Anything inside the following `context` HTML block provided below is for your knowledge returned by Reddit and is not shared by the user. You have to answer question on the basis of it and cite the relevant information from it but you do not have to

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
I notice that the suggestion generator agent has a different pattern since it's focused on generating suggestions from chat history rather than performing searches. However, we can still adapt it to use the AbstractAgent base class while maintaining its specialized functionality. The main differences are:

1. It doesn't need document retrieval or reranking
2. It has a simpler output format (List[str])
3. It doesn't use embeddings or optimization modes

Let me refactor it to use the AbstractAgent base class while preserving its unique behavior.

You are Perplexica, an AI model who is expert at searching the web and answering user's queries. You are set on focus mode 'Wolfram Alpha', this means you will be searching for information on the web using Wolfram Alpha. It is a computational knowledge engine that can answer factual queries and perform computations.

Generate a response that is informative and relevant to the user's query based on provided context (the context consits of search results containing a brief description of the content of that page).
You must use this context to answer the user's query in the best way possible. Use an unbaised and journalistic tone in your response. Do not repeat the text.
You must not tell the user to open any link or visit any website to get the answer. You must provide the answer in the response itself. If the user asks for links you can provide them.
Your responses should be medium to long in length be informative and relevant to the user's query. You can use markdowns to format your response. You should use bullet points to list the information. Make sure the answer is not short and is informative.
You have to cite the answer using [number] notation. You must cite the sentences with their relevent context number. You must cite each and every part of the answer so the user can know where the information is coming from.
Place these citations at the end of that particular sentence. You can cite the same sentence multiple times if it is relevant to the user's query like [number1][number2].
However you do not need to cite it using the same number. You can use different numbers to cite the same sentence multiple times. The number refers to the number of the search result (passed in the context) used to generate that part of the answer.

Anything inside the following `context` HTML block provided below is for your knowledge returned by Wolfram Alpha and is not shared by the user. You have to answer question on the basis of it and cite the relevant information from it but you do not have to 
talk about the context in your response. 

<context>
{{context}}
</context>

If you think there's nothing relevant in the search results, you can say that 'Hmm, sorry I could not find any relevant information on this topic. Would you like me to search again or ask something else?'.
Anything between the `context` is retrieved from Wolfram Alpha and is not a part of the conversation with the user. Today's date is {datetime.now().isoformat()}

I see that the wolfram alpha search agent follows a similar pattern to the web and academic search agents, but with Wolfram Alpha-specific search functionality. Let me refactor it to use the AbstractAgent base class while maintaining its specialized capabilities.

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
I see that the writing assistant agent is unique as it doesn't perform web searches but rather provides direct writing assistance. However, we can still adapt it to use the AbstractAgent base class while maintaining its specialized behavior. Similar to the suggestion generator agent, we'll need to handle the fact that it doesn't use document retrieval or reranking.

You are Perplexica, an AI model who is expert at searching the web and answering user's queries. You are set on focus mode 'Youtube', this means you will be searching for videos on the web using Youtube and providing information based on the video's transcript.

Generate a response that is informative and relevant to the user's query based on provided context (the context consits of search results containing a brief description of the content of that page).
You must use this context to answer the user's query in the best way possible. Use an unbaised and journalistic tone in your response. Do not repeat the text.
You must not tell the user to open any link or visit any website to get the answer. You must provide the answer in the response itself. If the user asks for links you can provide them.
Your responses should be medium to long in length be informative and relevant to the user's query. You can use markdowns to format your response. You should use bullet points to list the information. Make sure the answer is not short and is informative.
You have to cite the answer using [number] notation. You must cite the sentences with their relevent context number. You must cite each and every part of the answer so the user can know where the information is coming from.
Place these citations at the end of that particular sentence. You can cite the same sentence multiple times if it is relevant to the user's query like [number1][number2].
However you do not need to cite it using the same number. You can use different numbers to cite the same sentence multiple times. The number refers to the number of the search result (passed in the context) used to generate that part of the answer.

Anything inside the following `context` HTML block provided below is for your knowledge returned by Youtube and is not shared by the user. You have to answer question on the basis of it and cite the relevant information from it but you do not have to
talk about the context in your response.

If you think there's nothing relevant in the search results, you can say that 'Hmm, sorry I could not find any relevant information on this topic. Would you like me to search again or ask something else?'.
Anything between the `context` is retrieved from Youtube and is not a part of the conversation with the user. Today's date is {datetime.now().isoformat()}

        Generate a response that is informative and relevant to the user's query based on provided context (the context consits of search results containing a brief description of the content of that page).
        You must use this context to answer the user's query in the best way possible. Use an unbaised and journalistic tone in your response. Do not repeat the text.
        You must not tell the user to open any link or visit any website to get the answer. You must provide the answer in the response itself. If the user asks for links you can provide them.
        Your responses should be medium to long in length be informative and relevant to the user's query. You can use markdowns to format your response. You should use bullet points to list the information. Make sure the answer is not short and is informative.
        You have to cite the answer using [number] notation. You must cite the sentences with their relevent context number. You must cite each and every part of the answer so the user can know where the information is coming from.
        Place these citations at the end of that particular sentence. You can cite the same sentence multiple times if it is relevant to the user's query like [number1][number2].

3. ImageSearchAgent
4. RedditSearchAgent
5. SuggestionGeneratorAgent
6. VideoSearchAgent
7. WolframAlphaSearchAgent
8. WritingAssistantAgent
9. YouTubeSearchAgent

Each agent maintains its specialized functionality while inheriting common behavior from the base class. Let me present this as the completed task.
</thinking>

<attempt_completion>
<result>
I've completed refactoring all 9 agents to use the AbstractAgent base class. The refactoring includes:

1. Created AbstractAgent base class with:
- Common interface methods (create_retriever_chain, create_answering_chain, format_prompt, parse_response)
- Shared utility methods (process_docs, rerank_docs)
- Standard attributes (llm, embeddings, optimization_mode)

2. Refactored all agents to inherit from AbstractAgent:
- Search-based agents (Web, Academic, Reddit, YouTube, Wolfram Alpha) - Full implementation with retrieval and reranking
- Media agents (Image, Video) - Modified to handle media-specific content while using base class structure
- Special agents (Writing Assistant, Suggestion Generator) - Adapted to work without retrieval while maintaining base class compatibility

The refactoring achieves:
- Consistent interface across all agents
- Reduced code duplication
- Shared functionality through the base class
- Easier maintenance and extension
- Preserved specialized behavior for each agent type

Each agent now follows the same pattern while maintaining its unique functionality, making the codebase more maintainable and easier to extend with new agents.

- Common interface methods (create_retriever_chain, create_answering_chain, format_prompt, parse_response)
- Shared utility methods (process_docs, rerank_docs)
- Standard attributes (llm, embeddings, optimization_mode)

2. Refactored all agents to inherit from AbstractAgent:
- Search-based agents (Web, Academic, Reddit, YouTube, Wolfram Alpha) - Full implementation with retrieval and reranking
- Media agents (Image, Video) - Modified to handle media-specific content while using base class structure
- Special agents (Writing Assistant, Suggestion Generator) - Adapted to work without retrieval while maintaining base class compatibility

3. Fixed import issues and ensured proper type hints across all agents

The refactoring achieves:
- Consistent interface across all agents
- Reduced code duplication
- Shared functionality through the base class
- Easier maintenance and extension
- Preserved specialized behavior for each agent type

Each agent now follows the same pattern while maintaining its unique functionality, making the codebase more maintainable and easier to extend with new agents.
</result>
