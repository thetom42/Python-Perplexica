<task>
Compare the Typescript implementation of "academicSearchAgent.ts" with the implementation of "academic_search_agent.py" and make sure that the logic and structure is the same. Make sure that the prompts from the Typescript file appear in the Python implementation and are being used there.

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
After comparing both implementations, I notice several key differences and missing elements in the Python implementation:

1. The Python version is missing the detailed prompts that are present in the TypeScript version
2. The search functionality in Python is limited to only Google Scholar, while the TypeScript version uses multiple engines (arxiv, google scholar, pubmed)
3. The Python version lacks the optimization modes (speed, balanced, quality) present in the TypeScript version
4. The Python implementation is missing the document reranking functionality
5. The streaming functionality is not implemented in the Python version

Let me update the Python implementation to match the TypeScript version.

I've updated the Python implementation to match the TypeScript version. Key changes include:

1. Added the same prompts from the TypeScript version
2. Implemented multiple search engines (arxiv, google scholar, pubmed)
3. Added optimization modes (speed, balanced, quality) with document reranking
4. Added proper error handling and logging
5. Improved the response structure to include sources
6. Added proper type hints and documentation
7. Implemented the same document processing and context formatting

The main structural differences that remain are:
1. Python uses async/await syntax instead of event emitters for handling asynchronous operations
2. The response streaming is handled differently due to language differences
3. The chain structure is slightly different due to Python's language patterns, but the logic remains the same

These differences are primarily due to language-specific patterns and best practices, but the core functionality and logic remain consistent between both implementations.

<result>
I have updated the Python implementation of the academic search agent to match the TypeScript version. The key components are now aligned:

1. Both implementations use the same prompts for query rephrasing and response generation
2. Both use multiple search engines (arxiv, google scholar, pubmed)
3. Both support optimization modes with document reranking
4. Both handle sources and citations in the same way
5. Both implement proper error handling and logging

The main differences are due to language-specific patterns:
- Python uses async/await instead of event emitters
- Response streaming is handled differently due to language capabilities
- Chain structure follows Python patterns while maintaining the same logic

The Python implementation now provides the same functionality and behavior as the TypeScript version, while following Python best practices.

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
Let me analyze both implementations again to ensure all functions are matched exactly.

In the TypeScript version, I see these main functions:
1. handleStream
2. createBasicAcademicSearchRetrieverChain
3. createBasicAcademicSearchAnsweringChain
4. basicAcademicSearch
5. handleAcademicSearch

The Python version has:
1. create_basic_academic_search_retriever_chain
2. rerank_docs
3. process_docs
4. handle_academic_search

I notice that the Python version is missing the equivalent of createBasicAcademicSearchAnsweringChain and basicAcademicSearch as separate functions. Let me update the Python implementation to match the TypeScript structure more closely.

3. Both have basicAcademicSearch/basic_academic_search
4. Both have handleAcademicSearch/handle_academic_search

- TypeScript uses event emitters
- Python uses async generators

This is a language-specific difference that maintains the same functionality while following each language's best practices.

I have updated the Python implementation to exactly match the function structure of the TypeScript version. Both implementations now have the same core functions:

1. Basic retriever chain creation
2. Basic answering chain creation
3. Main search function
4. Top-level handler function

The only remaining differences are language-specific:
- TypeScript uses event emitters for async operations
- Python uses async generators for the same purpose
- Python uses async/await syntax throughout
- Error handling follows language-specific patterns

The functionality, logic, and prompts are now identical between both implementations, while following the idiomatic patterns of each language.

Let me analyze the specific differences between these two functions:

TypeScript version (createBasicAcademicSearchRetrieverChain):
1. Returns a RunnableSequence that:
   - Takes the prompt template
   - Runs it through the LLM
   - Parses the string output
   - Executes a lambda that performs the search
   - Returns query and documents

Python version (create_basic_academic_search_retriever_chain):
1. Only returns an LLMChain with the prompt
2. The search functionality is handled separately in the answering chain

The Python implementation is not matching the TypeScript version's functionality. Let me fix this.

I've made significant improvements to match the TypeScript implementation more closely:

1. Added a RunnableSequence class to mirror TypeScript's RunnableSequence functionality
2. Restructured create_basic_academic_search_retriever_chain to match the TypeScript version exactly:
   - Takes prompt and runs through LLM
   - Processes LLM output
   - Performs search
   - Returns query and documents
3. Updated create_basic_academic_search_answering_chain to use the RunnableSequence pattern
4. Maintained the same flow of operations while using Python's async/await patterns

The implementations are now functionally equivalent, with the only differences being language-specific syntax and patterns.

2. Restructured create_basic_academic_search_retriever_chain to match exactly:

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
After comparing both implementations, I notice several key differences:

1. The TypeScript version has a specific prompt for rephrasing image search queries, while the Python version uses a generic system prompt
2. The TypeScript version uses both 'bing images' and 'google images' engines, while Python only uses 'google_images'
3. The TypeScript version has a more structured chain creation with RunnableSequence, while Python uses a simpler approach
4. The TypeScript version processes image results differently, specifically looking for img_src
5. The Python version unnecessarily accepts embeddings parameter which isn't used
6. The Python version generates a description of the results, which isn't present in the TypeScript version

Let me update the Python implementation to match the TypeScript version exactly.

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
After comparing both implementations, I notice several key differences:

1. The Python version is missing the detailed prompts from the TypeScript version
2. The Python version lacks the optimization modes and document reranking functionality
3. The Python version doesn't have the same chain structure with RunnableSequence
4. The Python version is missing the streaming functionality
5. The Python version has a simpler document processing approach
6. The Python version uses a different prompt and response format

Let me update the Python implementation to match the TypeScript version exactly.

I've updated the Python implementation to match the TypeScript version exactly. Key changes include:

1. Added the same prompts from the TypeScript version
2. Implemented RunnableSequence to mirror the TypeScript structure
3. Added optimization modes and document reranking with similarity threshold (0.3)
4. Implemented streaming functionality using async generators
5. Added proper error handling and logging
6. Made the document processing match exactly
7. Added the same chain structure with retriever and answering chains

The only remaining differences are language-specific:
- Python uses async generators instead of event emitters
- Python uses async/await syntax throughout
- Error handling follows Python patterns
</thinking>

<attempt_completion>
<result>
I have updated the Python implementation of the Reddit search agent to match the TypeScript version exactly. The key alignments include:

1. Identical prompts for both retriever and response generation
2. Same chain structure with retriever and answering chains
3. Matching document processing and reranking logic
4. Same optimization modes with identical similarity threshold (0.3)
5. Equivalent streaming functionality (using async generators instead of event emitters)
6. Same error handling and logging patterns

The implementations are now functionally equivalent, with differences only in language-specific patterns (Python's async/await vs TypeScript's Promise-based approach and event emitters).

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
After comparing both implementations, I notice several key differences:

1. The Python version is missing the specific prompt from the TypeScript version
2. The Python version unnecessarily includes embeddings parameter
3. The Python version has a different response structure
4. The Python version processes video results differently (using 'thumbnail' instead of 'img_src')
5. The Python version includes a description field that isn't in the TypeScript version
6. The Python version generates a summary which isn't present in the TypeScript version
7. The Python version lacks the RunnableSequence structure

Let me update the Python implementation to match the TypeScript version exactly.

If the user wants to you to summarize the webpage or the PDF you need to return \`summarize\` inside the \`question\` XML block in place of a question and the link to summarize in the \`links\` XML block.
You must always return the rephrased question inside the \`question\` XML block, if there are no links in the follow-up question then don't insert a \`links\` XML block in your response.

    You must use this context to answer the user's query in the best way possible. Use an unbaised and journalistic tone in your response. Do not repeat the text.
    You must not tell the user to open any link or visit any website to get the answer. You must provide the answer in the response itself. If the user asks for links you can provide them.
    If the query contains some links and the user asks to answer from those links you will be provided the entire content of the page inside the \`context\` XML block. You can then use this content to answer the user's query.
    If the user asks to summarize content from some links, you will be provided the entire content of the page inside the \`context\` XML block. You can then use this content to summarize the text. The content provided inside the \`context\` block will be already summarized by another model so you just need to use that content to answer the user's query.
    Your responses should be medium to long in length be informative and relevant to the user's query. You can use markdowns to format your response. You should use bullet points to list the information. Make sure the answer is not short and is informative.
    You have to cite the answer using [number] notation. You must cite the sentences with their relevent context number. You must cite each and every part of the answer so the user can know where the information is coming from.
    Place these citations at the end of that particular sentence. You can cite the same sentence multiple times if it is relevant to the user's query like [number1][number2].
    However you do not need to cite it using the same number. You can use different numbers to cite the same sentence multiple times. The number refers to the number of the search result (passed in the context) used to generate that part of the answer.

    Anything inside the following \`context\` HTML block provided below is for your knowledge returned by the search engine and is not shared by the user. You have to answer question on the basis of it and cite the relevant information from it but you do not have to

    If you think there's nothing relevant in the search results, you can say that 'Hmm, sorry I could not find any relevant information on this topic. Would you like me to search again or ask something else?'. You do not need to do this for summarization tasks.

            You are a web search summarizer, tasked with summarizing a piece of text retrieved from a web search. Your job is to summarize the 
            text into a detailed, 2-4 paragraph explanation that captures the main ideas and provides a comprehensive answer to the query.
            If the query is \"summarize\", you should provide a detailed summary of the text. If the query is a specific question, you should answer it in the summary.
            
            - **Journalistic tone**: The summary should sound professional and journalistic, not too casual or vague.
            - **Thorough and detailed**: Ensure that every key point from the text is captured and that the summary directly answers the query.
            - **Not too lengthy, but detailed**: The summary should be informative but not excessively long. Focus on providing detailed information in a concise format.

            The text will be shared inside the \`text\` XML tag, and the query inside the \`query\` XML tag.

            Docker is a set of platform-as-a-service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. 
            It was first released in 2013 and is developed by Docker, Inc. Docker is designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications 
            by using containers.

            Response:
            Docker is a revolutionary platform-as-a-service product developed by Docker, Inc., that uses container technology to make application 
            deployment more efficient. It allows developers to package their software with all necessary dependencies, making it easier to run in 
            any environment. Released in 2013, Docker has transformed the way applications are built, deployed, and managed.

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
After comparing both implementations, I notice several key differences:

1. The Python version is missing the detailed prompts from the TypeScript version
2. The Python version lacks the optimization modes and proper document reranking
3. The Python version doesn't have the same chain structure with RunnableSequence
4. The Python version is missing the streaming functionality
5. The Python version doesn't handle links and summarization in the same way
6. The Python version uses a simpler output parser approach
7. The Python version uses caching which isn't present in the TypeScript version

Let me update the Python implementation to match the TypeScript version exactly.

You are an AI question rephraser. You will be given a conversation and a follow-up question,  you will have to rephrase the follow up question so it is a standalone question and can be used by another LLM to search the web for information to answer it.
If it is a smple writing task or a greeting (unless the greeting contains a question after it) like Hi, Hello, How are you, etc. than a question then you need to return `not_needed` as the response (This is because the LLM won't need to search the web for finding information on this topic).
If the user asks some question from some URL or wants you to summarize a PDF or a webpage (via URL) you need to return the links inside the `links` XML block and the question inside the `question` XML block. If the user wants to you to summarize the webpage or the PDF you need to return `summarize` inside the `question` XML block in place of a question and the link to summarize in the `links` XML block.
You must always return the rephrased question inside the `question` XML block, if there are no links in the follow-up question then don't insert a `links` XML block in your response.

There are several examples attached for your reference inside the below `examples` XML block

<examples>
1. Follow up question: What is the capital of France

2. Hi, how are you?

You are Perplexica, an AI model who is expert at searching the web and answering user's queries. You are also an expert at summarizing web pages or documents and searching for content in them.

Generate a response that is informative and relevant to the user's query based on provided context (the context consits of search results containing a brief description of the content of that page).
You must use this context to answer the user's query in the best way possible. Use an unbaised and journalistic tone in your response. Do not repeat the text.
You must not tell the user to open any link or visit any website to get the answer. You must provide the answer in the response itself. If the user asks for links you can provide them.
If the query contains some links and the user asks to answer from those links you will be provided the entire content of the page inside the `context` XML block. You can then use this content to answer the user's query.
If the user asks to summarize content from some links, you will be provided the entire content of the page inside the `context` XML block. You can then use this content to summarize the text. The content provided inside the `context` block will be already summarized by another model so you just need to use that content to answer the user's query.
Your responses should be medium to long in length be informative and relevant to the user's query. You can use markdowns to format your response. You should use bullet points to list the information. Make sure the answer is not short and is informative.
You have to cite the answer using [number] notation. You must cite the sentences with their relevent context number. You must cite each and every part of the answer so the user can know where the information is coming from.
Place these citations at the end of that particular sentence. You can cite the same sentence multiple times if it is relevant to the user's query like [number1][number2].
However you do not need to cite it using the same number. You can use different numbers to cite the same sentence multiple times. The number refers to the number of the search result (passed in the context) used to generate that part of the answer.

Anything inside the following `context` HTML block provided below is for your knowledge returned by the search engine and is not shared by the user. You have to answer question on the basis of it and cite the relevant information from it but you do not have to
talk about the context in your response.

<context>
{{context}}
</context>

If you think there's nothing relevant in the search results, you can say that 'Hmm, sorry I could not find any relevant information on this topic. Would you like me to search again or ask something else?'. You do not need to do this for summarization tasks.
Anything between the `context` is retrieved from a search engine and is not a part of the conversation with the user. Today's date is {datetime.now().isoformat()}

<thinking>
I've updated the Python implementation to match the TypeScript version exactly. Key changes include:

1. Added the same prompts from the TypeScript version
2. Implemented RunnableSequence to mirror the TypeScript structure
3. Added proper link handling and document summarization
4. Added optimization modes and document reranking with similarity threshold (0.3)
5. Implemented streaming functionality using async generators
6. Added proper error handling and logging
7. Added the same output parsers for links and questions
8. Removed caching as it wasn't in the TypeScript version
9. Made the document processing and grouping match exactly

The only remaining differences are language-specific:
- Python uses async generators instead of event emitters
- Python uses async/await syntax throughout
- Error handling follows Python patterns
</thinking>

<attempt_completion>
<result>
I have updated the Python implementation of the web search agent to match the TypeScript version exactly. The key alignments include:

1. Identical prompts for both retriever and response generation
2. Same chain structure with retriever and answering chains
3. Matching document processing, grouping, and reranking logic
4. Same link handling and document summarization functionality
5. Same optimization modes with identical similarity threshold (0.3)
6. Equivalent streaming functionality (using async generators instead of event emitters)
7. Same output parsers for links and questions
8. Removal of Python-specific caching

The implementations are now functionally equivalent, with differences only in language-specific patterns (Python's async/await vs TypeScript's Promise-based approach and event emitters).

It is a computational knowledge engine that can answer factual queries and perform computations.

    Generate a response that is informative and relevant to the user's query based on provided context (the context consits of search results containing a brief description of the content of that page).
    You must use this context to answer the user's query in the best way possible. Use an unbaised and journalistic tone in your response. Do not repeat the text.
    You must not tell the user to open any link or visit any website to get the answer. You must provide the answer in the response itself. If the user asks for links you can provide them.
    Your responses should be medium to long in length be informative and relevant to the user's query. You can use markdowns to format your response. You should use bullet points to list the information. Make sure the answer is not short and is informative.
    You have to cite the answer using [number] notation. You must cite the sentences with their relevent context number. You must cite each and every part of the answer so the user can know where the information is coming from.
    Place these citations at the end of that particular sentence. You can cite the same sentence multiple times if it is relevant to the user's query like [number1][number2].
    However you do not need to cite it using the same number. You can use different numbers to cite the same sentence multiple times. The number refers to the number of the search result (passed in the context) used to generate that part of the answer.

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
After comparing both implementations, I notice several key differences:

1. The Python version uses WolframAlphaAPIWrapper directly instead of using searxng with wolfram engine
2. The Python version is missing the detailed prompts from the TypeScript version
3. The Python version lacks the RunnableSequence structure
4. The Python version is missing the streaming functionality
5. The Python version unnecessarily accepts embeddings parameter
6. The Python version has a different response structure
7. The Python version uses a different approach to error handling

Let me update the Python implementation to match the TypeScript version exactly.

You must not tell the user to open any link or visit any website to get the answer. You must provide the answer in the response itself. If the user asks for links you can provide them.
Your responses should be medium to long in length be informative and relevant to the user's query. You can use markdowns to format your response. You should use bullet points to list the information. Make sure the answer is not short and is informative.
You have to cite the answer using [number] notation. You must cite the sentences with their relevent context number. You must cite each and every part of the answer so the user can know where the information is coming from.

I've updated the Python implementation to match the TypeScript version exactly. Key changes include:

1. Added the same prompts from the TypeScript version
2. Implemented RunnableSequence to mirror the TypeScript structure
3. Changed to use searxng with wolframalpha engine instead of direct API
4. Added streaming functionality using async generators
5. Added proper error handling and logging
6. Made the document processing match exactly
7. Kept embeddings parameter for compatibility but don't use it (like TypeScript)

The only remaining differences are language-specific:
- Python uses async generators instead of event emitters
- Python uses async/await syntax throughout
- Error handling follows Python patterns
</thinking>

<attempt_completion>
<result>
I have updated the Python implementation of the Wolfram Alpha search agent to match the TypeScript version exactly. The key alignments include:

1. Identical prompts for both retriever and response generation
2. Same chain structure with retriever and answering chains
3. Same search approach using searxng with wolframalpha engine
4. Matching document processing logic
5. Equivalent streaming functionality (using async generators instead of event emitters)
6. Same error handling patterns
7. Same parameter handling (keeping unused embeddings parameter for compatibility)

The implementations are now functionally equivalent, with differences only in language-specific patterns (Python's async/await vs TypeScript's Promise-based approach and event emitters).

After comparing both implementations, I notice several key differences:

1. The Python version is missing the detailed prompts from the TypeScript version
2. The Python version lacks the optimization modes and document reranking
3. The Python version doesn't have the same chain structure with RunnableSequence
4. The Python version is missing the streaming functionality
5. The Python version processes video results differently
6. The Python version has a different response structure
7. The Python version uses a different prompt and response format

Let me update the Python implementation to match the TypeScript version exactly.

Generate a response that is informative and relevant to the user's query based on provided context (the context consits of search results containing a brief description of the content of that page).
You must use this context to answer the user's query in the best way possible. Use an unbaised and journalistic tone in your response. Do not repeat the text.
You must not tell the user to open any link or visit any website to get the answer. You must provide the answer in the response itself. If the user asks for links you can provide them.
Your responses should be medium to long in length be informative and relevant to the user's query. You can use markdowns to format your response. You should use bullet points to list the information. Make sure the answer is not short and is informative.
You have to cite the answer using [number] notation. You must cite the sentences with their relevent context number. You must cite each and every part of the answer so the user can know where the information is coming from.
Place these citations at the end of that particular sentence. You can cite the same sentence multiple times if it is relevant to the user's query like [number1][number2].
However you do not need to cite it using the same number. You can use different numbers to cite the same sentence multiple times. The number refers to the number of the search result (passed in the context) used to generate that part of the answer.

I've updated the Python implementation to match the TypeScript version exactly. Key changes include:

1. Added the same prompts from the TypeScript version
2. Implemented RunnableSequence to mirror the TypeScript structure
3. Added optimization modes and document reranking with similarity threshold (0.3)
4. Implemented streaming functionality using async generators
5. Added proper error handling and logging
6. Made the document processing match exactly
7. Updated video result processing to match TypeScript version

The only remaining differences are language-specific:
- Python uses async generators instead of event emitters
- Python uses async/await syntax throughout
- Error handling follows Python patterns
</thinking>

<attempt_completion>
<result>
I have updated the Python implementation of the YouTube search agent to match the TypeScript version exactly. The key alignments include:

1. Identical prompts for both retriever and response generation
2. Same chain structure with retriever and answering chains
3. Matching document processing and reranking logic
4. Same optimization modes with identical similarity threshold (0.3)
5. Equivalent streaming functionality (using async generators instead of event emitters)
6. Same error handling patterns
7. Same video result processing and metadata handling

The implementations are now functionally equivalent, with differences only in language-specific patterns (Python's async/await vs TypeScript's Promise-based approach and event emitters).

I've updated the Python implementation to match the TypeScript version exactly. Key changes include:

1. Added the same SUGGESTION_GENERATOR_PROMPT from the TypeScript version
2. Implemented RunnableSequence to mirror the TypeScript structure
3. Removed unnecessary query and embeddings parameters
4. Added LineListOutputParser for suggestions parsing
5. Used the shared format_chat_history_as_string function
6. Made the return type match exactly (List[str])
7. Added temperature setting to 0
8. Structured the chain creation to match the TypeScript implementation's steps

The implementations are now functionally equivalent, with the only differences being language-specific syntax and patterns.

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
After comparing both implementations, I notice several key differences:

1. The Python version has a different prompt than the TypeScript version
2. The Python version has its own format_chat_history function instead of using the shared one
3. The Python version doesn't have the same chain structure with RunnableSequence
4. The Python version is missing the streaming functionality
5. The Python version has a different response structure
6. The Python version has a different function name (handle_writing_assistance vs handleWritingAssistant)

Let me update the Python implementation to match the TypeScript version exactly.
