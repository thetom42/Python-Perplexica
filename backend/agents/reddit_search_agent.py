    Handle a Reddit search query and generate a response based on search results.

    This function performs the following steps:
    1. Executes a Reddit search query using SearxNG with Reddit as the engine.
    2. Processes the search results to create a list of Reddit post information.
    3. Uses a language model to generate a summary of the Reddit search results.

    Args:
        query (str): The Reddit search query.
        history (List[BaseMessage]): The chat history (not used in the current implementation).
        llm (BaseChatModel): The language model to use for generating the response.
        embeddings (Embeddings): The embeddings model (not used in the current implementation).

    Returns:
        Dict[str, Any]: A dictionary containing the type of response, the generated summary,
                        and a list of Reddit post results.
