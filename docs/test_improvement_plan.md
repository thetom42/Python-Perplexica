# Test Improvement Plan

## Goals
1. Achieve 90% test coverage across all modules
2. Implement comprehensive error handling tests
3. Add integration tests between components
4. Incorporate property-based testing
5. Standardize test structure and documentation

## Current Status
- Unit test coverage: 75%
- Integration tests: Minimal
- Error handling tests: Partial coverage
- Property-based tests: Initial implementation

## Priority Areas
1. Low-coverage agents
2. Failing tests
3. Integration testing
4. Property-based testing

## Action Items

### Short-term (Next 2 weeks)
- [x] Add property-based tests for core functionality
- [x] Fix failing tests in YouTubeSearchAgent
- [x] Set up CI/CD pipeline with coverage thresholds
- [ ] Add error handling tests for all agents
- [ ] Implement test data factories

### Medium-term (Next month)
- [ ] Add integration tests between components
- [ ] Increase coverage for low-coverage agents
- [ ] Standardize test structure across all modules
- [ ] Add docstrings to all test methods

### Long-term (Next quarter)
- [ ] Achieve 90% test coverage
- [ ] Implement comprehensive logging assertions
- [ ] Add performance testing
- [ ] Create end-to-end testing framework

## Metrics
- Test coverage percentage
- Number of failing tests
- Number of edge cases covered
- Test execution time
- Code quality metrics (flake8, mypy)

## Responsibilities
- Core team: Implement test improvements
- QA team: Review test coverage and provide feedback
- DevOps: Maintain CI/CD pipeline
